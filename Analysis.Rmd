Calculating the probability that the number of women in tt positions is greater in the midwest compared to the other region listed
```{r}

# < 0.1 % probability that the selected schools in the Midwest have more women employed in tt positions compared to selected schools in the Northeast.

#NOTE THAT YOU CAN NEVER HAVE 0 OR 100, ONLY  LESS THAN 0.1 OR GREATER THAN 99.9

tt_diff %>%

Calculating the probability that the number of men employed in tt positions is greater than the number of women employed in tt positionsfor each region. 

Fun (?) fact, there is a >99.9% probability that more men are employed in tt positions compared to women for ALL regions.

Now I am curious about how South Dakota measures up to other regions. This is essentially the same as the above model but with SD instead of region
```{r}
get_prior(number ~ 1+gender*position*SD, data=gender_data, family=poisson, link="log")

sd_mod <- brm(number ~ 1+gender*position*SD,
                  family=poisson(link="log"),
                  data=gender_data %>% filter(gender==c("female", "male")),
                  prior=c(prior(normal(0.5,0.3), class="b"),
                          prior(normal(1,0.5), class="Intercept")),
                  file="sd_mod.RDS",
                  file_refit="on_change",
                  iter=4000, chains=3)


saveRDS(sd_mod, file="sd_mod.RDS")

# plot(conditional_effects(sd_mod))

pp_check(sd_mod, type="stat_grouped", group="gender")
pp_check(sd_mod, type="stat_grouped", group="SD")
pp_check(sd_mod, type="stat_grouped", group="position")
```

Making my data longer and calculating some of the necessary values from the South Dakota model
```{r}
sd_cond_data <- distinct(sd_mod$data) %>% 
  select(-number)

sd_mod_posts <- add_epred_draws(sd_mod, newdata=sd_cond_data)

sd_mod_posts$.row=NULL #had to do this to make R stop forcing the .row column grouping, does not influence calculations

#Making a data frame that I can use to calculate credible intervals
sd_test <- sd_mod_posts %>% 
  select(-.chain, -.iteration) %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "gender", values_from = ".epred") %>% 
  mutate(diff = male - female)

#Another data frame which I can use to calculate region and position specific values
sd_specific <- sd_test %>% 
  select(-diff) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(SD, .draw),
              names_from=position, 
              values_from=c("female", "male")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(.draw),
              names_from=SD,
              values_from=c("female_tt", "male_tt", "female_instructor", "male_instructor"))
  
```

Calculating credible intervals and other necessary values for the South Dakota model
```{r}
#Median credible interval for the difference in men and women at each position by sd

  median_qi(diff)

#Median credible interval for the number of women in each position by sd
sd_test %>% 
  group_by(SD, position) %>% 
  median_qi(female)

#Median credible interval for the number of men in each position by sd
sd_test %>% 
  group_by(SD, position) %>% 
  median_qi(male)

#Calculating the differences in female_tt by region and the difference between men and women employed in tt
sd_tt_diff <- sd_specific %>% 
  mutate(y_n_f_tt=female_tt_y-female_tt_n) %>% 
  mutate(m_f_sd_tt=male_tt_y-female_tt_y) %>% 
  mutate(m_f_notsd_tt=male_tt_n-female_tt_n)

```

Calculating the probabilities for the South Dakota model
```{r}
sd_tt_diff %>% 
  summarize(higher=sum(y_n_f_tt>0)/nrow(.))
#<0.1 % probability that schools in South Dakota employ more women in tt positions compared to schools not in South Dakota.

sd_tt_diff %>% 
  summarize(higher=sum(m_f_sd_tt>0)/nrow(.))
#>99.9 % probability that schools in South Dakota employ more men than women in tt positions 

sd_tt_diff %>%

#>99.9 % probability that schools not in South Dakota employ more men than women in tt positions

Sensitivity analysis information from Bayes on March 29, 2022

Purpose of a sensitivity analysis is to determine if your priors are having too much influence on your model predictions

Here is how you do the sensitivity analysis: 
Don't worry about the mean of your data, double (or otherwise increase) your standard deviations to determine if your inference changes significantly. If it does not, this indicates that your model is not overly sensitive to the priors you have used. If the model is sensitive to the priors, as long as you justicy the priors, this is actually okay. It is all about the justification. In a paper or a presentation you would want to include the plot to show the visual inspection to support your model. This is simply a visual inspection, if they look close enough this is good enough, typically. 

In methods: "We performed a sensitivity analysis by re-running the model with wider (less-informative) priors."
