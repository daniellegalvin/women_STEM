This contains the data and code for the analysis conducted by select USD biology graduate students for the 2022 IDEAFest conference.

Data was collected by these students by locating the faculty list for each department at a given university. Best judgment was used to determine gender of each individual.

This is a living repository and is being updated semi-regularly until the analysis (and poster) is complete.
